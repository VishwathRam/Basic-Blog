# Basic-Blog
This is a template for a blog that allows users to sign in, view, search, and comment on blogposts. 
It also allows admins to create new posts and access, edit, or remove old ones.
The blog posts can be flagged liked or disliked by users and comments can be reported.
There is a dashboard for both users and admins where they can view their liked posts and edit their profile.
